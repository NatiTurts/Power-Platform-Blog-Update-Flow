# Staying up to date with Microsoft Power Automate
 
The idea behind this project was to consolidate all Power Platform updates into one email, usng our own HTML body. Although Power Automater already offers a template for a RSS feed on Power Atomate updates, despite being able to change the feed url, the notification still uses the defualt "Microsoft Flow" template.

Included in tis repo are the following:
  The exported flow.
  A list of all RSS Feeds used.
  A list of all variables used (it is crucial that the varibale names are exact if you wish to build the flow yourself and not import it. This is due to the varibales being referenced in the HTML body.
  A list of expressions used in the flow.
  
  Check out my blog to read how this flow was built and how you can import it.
